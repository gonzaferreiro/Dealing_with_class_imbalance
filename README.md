# Dealing_with_class_imbalance

In this repository you'll find a theoretical introduction to the problem of class imbalance, as well as a notebook with examples about how to use some of the algorithms mentioned in the theoretical guide.

# What you'll find in the notebook

* Load the dataset
* Fitting a regular model (including a function to fit models and print the regular metrics)
* Balancing classes by using 'class_weight='balanced'' in logistic regression
* Resampling using imbalance learn library
* Oversampling with SMOTE
* Oversampling with ADASYN
